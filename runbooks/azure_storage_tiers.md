# Azure Blob Storage Tiers Cost Optimisation

## Storage Tiers Explained
- Hot tier: Frequently accessed data, high cost per GB, low access cost
- Cool tier: Infrequently accessed 30 plus days, medium cost per GB
- Cold tier: Rarely accessed 90 plus days, low cost per GB
- Archive tier: Long-term 180 plus days, very low cost, high retrieval cost

## Savings by Moving Tiers
- Hot to Cool: 50% storage cost reduction
- Hot to Archive: 90% storage cost reduction

## Lifecycle Management

This saves money without manual intervention every month.
